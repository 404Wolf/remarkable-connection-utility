                 reMarkable Connection Utility (RCU)
                =====================================

RCU is a desktop client for all-in-one offline management of reMarkable 
e-paper tablets. It lets users create and restore low-level backups,
take screenshots, manage notebooks, templates, wallpaper, and
third-party software, and act as a virtual printer. It ensures the
user's data is completely in their control, unshackled from the
manufacturer's proprietary cloud service.

RCU differs from other software because it runs under every major PC
operating system, its copyright is unencumbered and libre, and most of
all it has unique functions that costlier software--and the tablet's
own manufacturer--can't match. Notably, RCU has a custom PDF renderer
that can generate PDFs with true layers, true highlight annotations,
customizable ink colors, either vector or bitmap graphics, with higher
resolution and lower file size than reMarkable's own software.

The RCU User Manual is the primary source of documentation. It was 
written with the utmost care; please read it carefully.

Financial contributions directly support RCU's development and
maintenance. If you find the program useful, please purchase a copy
from the author at:  http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/  If you find
that RCU is worth more to you than the amount you paid, please buy
another copy.
